The Marlborough Sports Awards has been the premier Sports Awards event in the Marlborough province since 1967.

Over the course of the last half decade many local, national, world and Olympic champions have been honoured for their achievements and their impact on our community. Since its inception, more than 300 Marlborough people have attended this event annually.

In 2022, the Marlborough Sports Awards will be organised and presented by key partners; Blenheim Round Table, Sport Tasman and Top South Media.

The Marlborough Sports Awards is an opportunity to acknowledge some of our top sportspeople amongst family, friends and the wider community. We encourage all sports codes to get involved, to showcase the efforts of their leading performers over the past 12 months. Nominations are not limited to athletes; coaches, managers and officials may also be put forward.

This yearâ€™s event will take place during November at the Marlborough Convention Centre. There are five award categories, the winner of each going in the running for the Overall Sportsperson of the Year Award.
